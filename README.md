# Simple-backup-script
I made this script for myself because I wanted a simple way to back up my data to my external hard disk without the needs for anything more advance than that and I shared it because I though somene else might need a simple solution as well.

Simple backup is a shell script for linux or mac to help you automate your backups to an external device and keep an archive
